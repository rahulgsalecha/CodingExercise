The provided code snippet may encounter following potential problems :

1. Producer keeps on adding elements to the queue regardless of the queue capacity.
2. Producer is unaware of the status of elements being removed from the queue by the Consumers
3. Consumer can run in an infinite loop to see if elements are available in queue to process.
4. Consumer is not notifying the Producer and other consumers that it has removed an element.
5. There is no thread safe access of element from the queue.

The potential solutions we can think of to solve this problem are :

1. Producer should monitor the queue size and enter into sleep/delay/wait mode when queue size is full.
    This can be done by implementing a blocking queue of fixed size. In this way, the producer will wait
    for the elements to be removed from queue by consumers when queue is full.
2. Consumer should monitor whether queue is empty or not and if it empty, the cosumer enters sleep/delay/wait mode.
    It will resume operations when elements are available for processing.
    This can also be achieved using blocking queue implementation.
3. Use Thread-safe queues.
